                        use the crochet hook method to tighten the roots and fix any loose hairs. This package takes
                        about 2 to 3 hours, depending on the condition of your dreadlocks.</td>

                        can do braids, buns, updos, mohawks, and more. This package takes about 1 to 2 hours, depending
                        on the complexity of the style.</td>
