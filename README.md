User Experience (UX)
Introduction
I-Three Dreadlocks Salon
Welcome to I-Three Dreadlocks Salon! Our salon showcases our expertise in dreadlocks styling. Whether you’re a client or just curious, this README will guide you through our project.

 I-Three User Experience Principles
 The purpose of the I-Three Dreadlocks Salon project is to create an online platform where clients can explore dreadlocks styling services, view a gallery of stunning transformations, and get in touch with the salon. Whether you’re interested in our services or simply curious, our website aims to provide a seamless experience for anyone seeking excellence in dreadlocks.

At I-Three, we prioritize user experience (UX) as a fundamental aspect of our product development process. Our UX principles guide us in creating intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable experiences for our users. Here are the key principles we follow:
*User-Centric Design: I opted for this to cater for user needs, behaviors, and goals in the design process.
*Simplicity and Clarity: Was used to keep interfaces intuitive, easy to navigate, and visually clear.
*Consistency: To maintain uniformity in design elements and interaction patterns, consistency was employed.
*Accessibility and Inclusivity: Was used to make sure that all users can access the items by adhering to accessibility guidelines.
*Feedback and Responsiveness: Provide clear feedback for user actions and ensure responsiveness across devices.
*Emotional Engagement: Create experiences that evoke positive emotions and forge connections with users.
*Continuous Improvement: Iterate and refine products based on data, metrics, and user feedback for ongoing enhancement.

Design. Colour Scheme
Colour Selection: Utilise colour websites to choose background and foreground colours, ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments.
Planned Alternative Text: Develop alternative text equivalents for non-text elements to accommodate visually impaired users.
Accessibility Considerations: Prioritize accessibility features to ensure inclusivity and usability for all users, including those with disabilities.
Inclusive Design: Implement design strategies that consider diverse user needs and abilities to create a universally accessible experience.
Testing and Feedback: Conduct thorough testing and gather feedback from users, including those with disabilities, to identify areas for improvement and ensure optimal accessibility.

##Features
The website consists of three pages and a modal. Home, Packages, Gallery and Booking modal.

All three pages have the following elements in common:
A responsive navigation bar at the top of the page allows the user to easily explore the website. On the right-hand side of the navigation bar are links to the packages page, gallery page and booking modal. To enable a positive user experience the navigation links are condensed into a burger toggler button on smaller devices. This was done to prevent the navigation bar from looking cluttered.
A footer that comprises of social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube. The footer also contains the address of the company.

##Home Page: Learn about our salon, our mission, and our commitment to excellence.
Four different images of clean styled dreadlocks in the header.
A heading and paragraph explaining who I-Three are.

##Booking: Reach out to us via email or the booking form.
I have included a booking form for customers to reach us for inquiry or concerns. 
A where to find us section, displaying a map from Google and the companies address, email and phone number. The map on the Homepage points to a coffee house in Ireland. As Dhadda's Detailing is not a real business I opted to use the iframe link from the Coffee Coders project.

Accessibility
I've taken care when coding to make the website as user-friendly and as accessible as I can. I've accomplished this by:
Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes for images throughout the site.
Selecting a sans-serif font which is suitable for users with dyslexia.
Ensuring that the site has an adequate amount of colour contrast in regards to a "Dreadlocks Salon."

Testing
Testing was continuous throughout the website build. I used Chrome developer tools to identify and address any issues as they arose.

My mentor also pointed out that the images within the website were .png format which hindered the performance of the website. To combat this all images have been converted to .webp format to significantly improve performance.

On the Packages page. the list items were out of alignment and not centered even after using the bootstrap text-center class. This was due to padding, which has now been removed to center the list of items.

W3C Validator
W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

##HTML Validator Screenshots of errors and correction.

##Validated with w3c JigSaw validator.

One issue I was coming across when testing my html page was an error displayed by w3. Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.' However, even after removing these trailing slashes when saving my document Visual Studio Code would re-enter them. Luckily as w3 states these have no effect on the code.
