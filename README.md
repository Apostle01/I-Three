    I opted for a clean modern colour pallete where each colour compliments one another. The colour pallete was created using the [coolers](https://coolors.co/) website.

    ### Typography

    Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

    -Roboto is used across the site for all text on the site. It is a sans-serif font.

    ### Wireframes

    ### Home Page

    ##Features
    The website consists of three pages and a modal. Home, Packages, Gallery and Booking modal.

    All three pages have the following elements in common:
    A responsive navigation bar at the top of the page allows the user to easily explore the website. On the right-hand side of the navigation bar are links to the packages page, gallery page and booking modal. To enable a positive user experience the navigation links are condensed into a burger toggler button on smaller devices. This was done to prevent the navigation bar from looking cluttered.
    A footer that comprises of social media links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube. The footer also contains the address of the company.

### Home Page: Learn about our salon, our mission, and our commitment to excellence.

## Testing

Testing was continuous throughout the website build. I used Chrome developer tools to identify and address any issues as they arose.

- Upon meeting with my mentor, we identified that my initial colour scheme had contrast issues. This has been resolved by choosing a new colour scheme that allows for adequate contrast been background and foreground colours.

- My mentor also pointed out that the images within the website were .png format which hindered the performance of the website. To combat this some images have been converted to .jpg format to significantly improve performance.

- On the Packages page. the list items were out of alignment and not centered even after using the bootstrap text-center class. This was due to padding, which has now been removed to center the list of items.

### W3C Validator

W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

One issue I was coming across when testing my html page was an error displayed by w3. Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.' However, even after removing these trailing slashes when saving my document Visual Studio Code would re-enter them. Luckily as w3 states these have no effect on the code.
